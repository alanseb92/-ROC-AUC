# -ROC-AUC

This ROC visualization plot should aid at understanding the trade-off between the rates. We can also qunatify area under the curve also know as AUC using scikit-learn’s roc_auc_score metric, in order to assess the performance of the model. The closer the score to 1 the better the model distinguishes the clasess, if it’s closer to 0.5 then your model performs just as badly as the coin flip.
